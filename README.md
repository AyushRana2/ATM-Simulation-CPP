# ATM Simulation Project (C++)

This is a console-based ATM Simulation System written in **C++** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project simulates basic ATM functionalities, including:

- ✅ Multiple users
- ✅ PIN-based login system
- ✅ Deposit and withdrawal options
- ✅ Mini statement to track transactions
- ✅ Limited login attempts

## 🚀 Features
- **User Authentication**: Supports secure login with a PIN.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Allows users to check their account balance.
- **Deposit**: Users can deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient balance.
- **Mini Statement**: Users can view a mini statement showing their recent transactions (deposit/withdrawal).
- **Account Details**: View account holder information and balance.
- **Limited Login Attempts**: Prevents unauthorized access with limited login retries (3 attempts).

## 📂 Project Structure
